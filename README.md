Table Map Helper module for Foundry VTT to cover some of my needs.
Mostly poping out the chat and combat trackers from a MapTable instance from your own GM instance. This helps me having different windows with Player visibility without having to do it manually over my table instance.

## Important: Foundry V13 support

Foundry V13 is not supported yet as neither Table Map or Popout! modules are compatible yet. I'll update this module as soon as they are compatible.

## Features

- Popout chat and combat tracker from Table Map instance

## Installation

Install via the Foundry VTT module manager by providing the manifest URL:

```plaintext
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WiNG-CoMM/WiNG-Table-Map-Helper/refs/heads/main/module.json
```

## Usage

Right click over your desired player in the Players menu and select "Popout Chat (Table Map)", "Popout Combat (Table Map)" or "Popout All (Table Map)".

## Hotkey Support:
- `Ctrl+Shift+P`: Popout both chat and combat tracker from Table Map instance

You may change this hotkey in the Foundry VTT Configure Controls menu, under the WiNG Table Map Helper section.

## Ko-fi link if you feel like it

If you enjoy using WiNG-Table-Map-Helper and feel that you would like to throw some extra support then consider buying me a coffee! This module is free and will always be free. No support will ever be needed. I do have a job and can afford to pay my bills fortunately. But, in any case, you can do it here if you wish:
